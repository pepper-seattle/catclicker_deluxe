# Hacktoberfest and Cat Clicker Deluxe
In an effort to build the most ridiculous and awesome cat clicker game out there today I invite you to fork this repo and do your best/worst! You'll get some points towards a killer Hacktoberfest t-shirt and the satisfaction that you've helped society in no way, shape, or form by improving this game.

## Cat Clicker Deluxe

# How to Play

1. Click on that cat.
2. Marvel in the number of times you've clicked on that cat.
3. Rinse, repeat.

# Rules for Contributing

1. Keep it clean (no porn, nsfw, killer cat clowns from outer space).
2. No harmful code.
3. No advertising/pimping yo' sh*t (cat clicker doesn't need sponsorship at this time).
4. Once you've completed your work add yourself as a contributor to the list below.
