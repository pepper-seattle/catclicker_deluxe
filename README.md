# Hacktoberfest and Cat Clicker Deluxe
In an effort to build the most ridiculous and awesome cat clicker game out there today I invite you to fork this repo and do your best/worst! You'll get some points towards a killer Hacktoberfest t-shirt and the satisfaction that you've helped society in no way, shape, or form by improving this game.

## Cat Clicker Deluxe

# How to Play

1. Click on that cat.
2. Marvel in the number of times you've clicked on that cat.
3. Rinse, repeat.
4. Click on the counter to start it all over again.

# Rules for Contributing

1. Keep it clean (no porn, nsfw, killer cat clowns from outer space).
2. No harmful code.
3. No advertising/pimping yo' sh*t (cat clicker doesn't need sponsorship at this time).
4. Once you've completed your work add yourself as a contributor to the list below.
